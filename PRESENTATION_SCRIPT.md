# 5-Minute Presentation Script
## Students' Perception, Trust, and Ethical Awareness of AI Tools in Education

---

## INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)

"Good [morning/afternoon]. Today I'm presenting findings from our survey on students' perception and use of AI tools in education. We collected 41 responses from students across 20+ degree programs to understand how AI is being used academically and what concerns students have. This is timely because AI tools like ChatGPT have become prevalent in education, and we need to understand the implications."

---

## METHODOLOGY (30 seconds)

"We used Simple Random Sampling via Google Forms, collecting 41 responses from November 23-24. I want to be transparent about limitations: our sample is relatively small, skewed toward Computer Science students, and represents only a snapshot in time. However, our data shows strong internal consistency, giving us confidence in the patterns we found."

## KEY FINDINGS (2 minutes)

**The Paradox - Sophisticated AI Literacy:**

"Here's our most important finding: Students demonstrate **sophisticated AI literacy**—they use AI extensively but maintain healthy skepticism."

**[Show Visualization 02_familiarity_usage.png]**

**High Adoption:**
- 80% very/extremely familiar with AI
- 60% use AI often or daily
- ChatGPT dominates at 85% usage
- 73% have used AI for over 1 year

**But Also High Skepticism:**
- 76% rate AI as only "moderately accurate"
- 73% always or often double-check outputs
- 85% concerned about misinformation

**What They Want:**
"The #1 trustworthiness factor? **Source transparency**—mentioned 19 times. Students want citations, not just answers. They want to learn *with* AI, not just *from* AI."

**Ethical Awareness:**
- 78% worry about plagiarism
- **80% want clear school guidelines** ← This is critical
- Main concerns: over-reliance weakening critical thinking, privacy, plagiarism

**[Show Visualization 05_ethical_awareness.png]**

**Future Outlook:**
- 75% believe AI skills are career-critical
- 91% interested in AI courses
- Want to learn: prompt engineering, responsible use, data analysis

**Quote that Captures It All:**
"One student said: 'I am very thankful that AI helped throughout my senior high. And sadly, it lead to weaken my critical thinking.' This shows students recognize both benefits and risks."

## WHAT TO DO WITH THIS DATA (1.5 minutes)

**Three Immediate Actions:**

**1. Develop Clear AI Usage Policies (URGENT)**
"80% of students are asking for guidelines. We need to:
- Define acceptable vs. unacceptable use with concrete examples
- Establish clear consequences
- Make policies transparent and accessible

**Action:** Form a task force within 30 days with student representation."

**2. Integrate AI Literacy into Curriculum**
"Students want to learn prompt engineering and verification skills. We should:
- Add AI literacy to first-year orientation
- Teach discipline-specific AI use
- Focus on critical evaluation, not just usage

**Don't ban AI—teach students to use it responsibly.**"

**3. Design Assignments That Promote Critical Thinking**
"Create assignments where students must:
- Compare AI answers with traditional research
- Identify errors in AI outputs
- Use AI as a starting point, not the final answer

**Example:** 'Use AI to generate a draft, then critically evaluate it, identify three weaknesses, and revise with proper citations.'"

## CONCLUSION (30 seconds)

**The Opportunity:**
"Students aren't asking us to ban AI—they're asking us to help them use it responsibly. We have a generation that's critically aware and wants guidance."

**Call to Action:**
"The question isn't whether AI will be part of education—it already is. The question is whether we'll provide the structure students are asking for. Based on this data, we have a clear path forward: policies, literacy training, and thoughtful integration."

**Final Thought:**
"Students want to learn *with* AI, not just *from* AI. Let's help them do that."

## TIME BREAKDOWN:
- Introduction: 30 sec
- Methodology: 30 sec
- Key Findings: 2 min
- What to Do: 1.5 min
- Conclusion: 30 sec
- **Total: 5 minutes**

## DELIVERY TIPS:
✓ Speak confidently and clearly
✓ Make eye contact, don't just read
✓ Emphasize the 80% statistic—it's your strongest call to action
✓ Show enthusiasm about the opportunity, not alarm about the problem
✓ If time allows, pause briefly after "What to Do" for questions

## KEY STATISTICS TO REMEMBER:
- **80%** want guidelines (most important)
- **73%** verify AI outputs (shows critical thinking)
- **19** mentions of source transparency (what students value most)
- **75%** see AI as career-critical (why this matters)

## IF ASKED QUESTIONS:

**"Isn't the sample too small?"**
"Yes, 41 is small, which is why we need larger studies. But 80% requesting guidelines is a strong signal regardless of sample size—it warrants action now."

**"How do we prevent cheating?"**
"Students aren't trying to cheat—85% are concerned about doing the right thing. Focus on education and design, not prevention. Create assignments where AI use is transparent and documented."

**"Won't this be expensive?"**
"The most critical actions—policies and curriculum integration—don't require new funding, just coordination. The alternative—not addressing this—could be more expensive."
